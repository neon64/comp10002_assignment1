.h 1 Testing   The .h Command
Ok, so that was a level one heading.

.h 2 The .h command (again)

And that was a level two heading.

.h 2 The .h command (a third time)

1---5---10---15---20---25---30---35---40
And that was a second level two heading, it's all a bit boring really.

.h 3 A third level heading

.h 5 And straight away a fifth level heading

.h 4 Followed by a fourth level heading

.h 5 And then another fifth level heading

It is all not just a bit boring, but actually really really boring
-- this text should be in paragraph
number 1.2.1.1.1, if I have counted correctly.
And the lines should be not more than 40 characters long.

.h 1 The Last .h Command

What else to say? It's hard creating these files of meaningless test data.
It just gets so challenging to be creative.
.c
.c But Not Always!

.h 1 The End of the Testing
This test file doesn't change
the left margin or the width, except at the beginning, before any of the output
is generated (except that first overall ruler). It just explores the heading and centering commands that were a required part of a Stage Three program, using a
 .l left margin of 10 and a .w width of 40.
.c
.c Maybe your program worked!
