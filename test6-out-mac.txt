          1 Testing The .h Command

          Ok, so that was a level one heading.

          1.1 The .h command (again)

          And that was a level two heading.

          1.2 The .h command (a third time)

          1---5---10---15---20---25---30---35---40
          And that was a second level two heading,
          it's all a bit boring really.

          1.2.1 A third level heading

          1.2.1.0.1 And straight away a fifth level heading

          1.2.1.1 Followed by a fourth level heading

          1.2.1.1.1 And then another fifth level heading

          It is all not just a bit boring, but
          actually really really boring -- this
          text should be in paragraph number
          1.2.1.1.1, if I have counted correctly.
          And the lines should be not more than 40
          characters long.

          2 The Last .h Command

          What else to say? It's hard creating
          these files of meaningless test data. It
          just gets so challenging to be creative.

                      But Not Always!

          3 The End of the Testing

          This test file doesn't change the left
          margin or the width, except at the
          beginning, before any of the output is
          generated (except that first overall
          ruler). It just explores the heading and
          centering commands that were a required
          part of a Stage Three program, using a
          .l left margin of 10 and a .w width of
          40.

                 Maybe your program worked!
