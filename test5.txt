STAGE TWO TEST.
.p
Ok, so this test file contains some Stage Two commands.
In Stage Two, students need to be able to deal with

all of:
.b
 .b;
.b
 .p;
.b
 .l nn; and
.b
 .w nn.

.p
.p
.p
Repeated ".p" commands should result in a single new paragraph occurring;
and the default left margin of 4 and the default width of 50 should be in operation, here is a ruler to help you check on that:
1---5---10---15---20---25---30---35---40---45---50
.l 15
.l 10
.l 2
And repeated ".l" commands (like there just were in the input text) should result in a new left margin equal to the last of the values entered, without multiple paragraph breaks getting generated;
this paragraph should have a two-character left margin,
and still have a width of 50 characters, here is the ruler again:
1---5---10---15---20---25---30---35---40---45---50
.w 40
Finally, if ".w" is used, the line width gets altered; this line should be
in
a
paragraph with a width of 40 characters.

So, to recap: at this point we should have a left margin of two characters, and up to 40 characters per line used by the text.
Care to count, anyone? Here is a ruler to make use of...
1---5---10---15---20---25---30---35---40
.w 30
And now, after another paragraph break, the lines


			should     
			be
			thirty
			characters
			long, here is another ruler to let you check.
.b
1---5---10---15---20---25---30---35---40
That ruler was preceded by a ".b" command, but there shouldn't be a blank line

in front of it, even though it is a long token that exceeds the current line width.
.p
Ok, that's enough.
Good luck with dealing with all of that Stage Two output.
And hey, PS, note that there are no Stage Three commands in this test, so
Stage Two and Stage Three programs will generate the same output.
.p
(But a Stage One program will have just given one very long paragraph for this input file.)
