STAGE
ONE:

This test data		mostly just  contains text 
and whitespace,

			and   no   formatting   commands.          
Students who

generate the right output for this test	file have a 
program that meets the Stage 1 (or better) expectations.

.x This text should not appear, as   it is in a line that starts with a .x, and should be discarded by a Stage One program.

The 
 .p
command indicates a new paragraph, but only when the full-stop
		is in column one, and only for a Stage Two program, and that ".p" wasn't in column one, so a ".p"
		should
		appear
		in
		the output.


Cool, yes?!
